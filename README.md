## Description

[Link to Live Site](https://nsantander1095.github.io/nsantander-portfolio-02/)

My personal web development portfolio showcases the work that I have done so far in the bootcamp. I have an about me section, that has a photo of myself as well as a small paragraph about my background in computer programming. I have a section that showcases my work, with images that link to the deployed webpages as well as titles that link to the respective project repository. My first image is much larger than my other four and sits above to showcase my only currently deployed webpage. Finally, I have a contact me section with a phone number, email, and other pertinent professional links. All of the links in the header scroll to their respective areas on the webpage. The webpage is also respponsive to resizing on different devices.
